# Image Captioning with Deep Learning  
**Automated caption generation using visual and textual feature fusion**

This project implements an end-to-end deep learning model that generates descriptive captions for images using the Flickr8k dataset. It combines computer vision (VGG16) and natural language processing (LSTM) techniques to understand visual content and produce human-readable descriptions.

## Key Features
- **Dual-input architecture** processes images and text sequences simultaneously
- **Transfer learning** with pre-trained VGG16 for efficient feature extraction
- **Sequence generation** using embedding layers and LSTM networks
- **Evaluation metrics** including BLEU scores for performance validation

## Architecture Overview
| Component          | Specification                          |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Image Encoder      | VGG16 + Flatten + Dense (256 units)    |
| Text Processor     | Embedding (200D) → Dropout (0.5) → LSTM (256 units) |
| Decoder            | TimeDistributed Dense (vocab_size) + Softmax |

## Performance Metrics
| Metric     | Score  |
|------------|--------|
| BLEU-1     | 0.5402 |
| BLEU-2     | 0.3247 |



## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.6+
- Keras
- NLTK
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Dataset
Uses the [Flickr8k Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k) containing:
- 8,000 images
- 5 captions per image
- Pre-trained VGG16 weights

## Sample Output
**Input Image**  
  

**Generated Caption**  
"A black dog is running through the grass"  

**Reference Captions**  
1. "A dog jumps over the wet ground"  
2. "Black canine playing in field"
